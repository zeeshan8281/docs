This is a [Vocs](https://vocs.dev) project bootstrapped with the Vocs CLI.

# Creating New Docs

You can create a new doc by adding a `.md` or `.mdx` file in
`apps/base-docs/docs/pages`.

The URL path for your doc will map to the file location. For instance, `bounty.mdx`
is found within `chain/security`. So the URL for this link will be:
`docs.base.org/chain/security/bounty`.

# Troubleshooting

```
TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'CookieBanner' of 'pkg' as it is undefined.
```

To resolve this:

2. comment out the lines:
```
import pkg from '@coinbase/cookie-banner';
const { CookieBanner } = pkg;
```

```
import { CookieBanner } from '@coinbase/cookie-banner';
```
