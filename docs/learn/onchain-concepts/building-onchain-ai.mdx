title: "AI Onchain"
description: "Learn how AI agents can manage economic value onchain using AgentKit to deploy contracts, create tokens, and manage funds autonomously on Base."

AI agents are quickly evolving, but most can't hold or manage economic value on their own. AgentKit bridges that gap by giving AI agents a wallet and "economic agency," letting them deploy contracts, create tokens, or manage funds autonomously on Base. In this final sub-section, you'll learn about practical use cases for combining AI with onchain functionality—and how AgentKit simplifies the process.

<Info>
**AI + Blockchain Challenge**: AI agents can read the web, but they typically can't manage crypto or execute onchain tasks.

<Tip>
**AgentKit Solution**: Gives AI agents "economic agency" by integrating them with onchain wallets, letting them deploy contracts, transfer tokens, and carry out tasks on Base autonomously. Bridge AI (LLMs) with crypto in a secure, straightforward way.
