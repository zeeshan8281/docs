description: "Learn about onchain accounts, from traditional EOAs using private keys to modern Smart Wallets with passkeys, and how Base's Smart Wallet SDK simplifies integration."

Onchain accounts, often called "wallets", are the starting point for any onchain interaction. Unlike traditional accounts that store credentials in a database, onchain accounts authenticate and authorize transactions on the public network with credentials held by the user. The original onchain accounts (EOA's) use private keys backed up by a sequence of 24 random words. Recently, with the introduction of modern accounts like Smart Wallet, the credentials are Passkeys which provide improved security and recoverability. This sub-section covers these two main wallet types, the differences in user experience and security, and how Base's Smart Wallet SDK makes them easier to integrate.

## What's Different?  

<Info>
Every onchain action requires an account (a wallet) to sign transactions. Onchain accounts can **hold funds** and also **authorize** transactions on a blockchain.

## Types of Onchain Accounts

### Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)

<Check>
**Traditional Model**: Private key + seed phrase model (e.g., MetaMask, Rabby, Ledger)
</Check>

<Warning>
**User Experience**: Commonly used today but can be cumbersome or risky for new users
</Warning>

<Info>
**Capabilities**: Holds digital assets but has no account level logic. Required for deploying smart contracts.
</Info>

### Smart Wallets

<Tip>
**Modern Approach**: Modern accounts with their own logic enabling improved security, recoverability, and functionality.
</Tip>

<Check>
**Enhanced Features**: Built-in recovery features, passkey authentication, and improved onboarding experience for users
</Check>

<Check>
**Advanced Permissions**: Can include features like "SpendPermissions" for fine-grained security and improved user experience
