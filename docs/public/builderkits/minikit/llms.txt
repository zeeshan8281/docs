  src="/images/minikit/minikit-cli.gif"
  height="364"/>

MiniKit is easiest way to build Mini Apps on Base, allowing developers to easily build applications without needing to know the details of the SDK implementation. It integrates seamlessly with OnchainKit components and provides Coinbase Wallet-specific hooks.

## Why MiniKit?

MiniKit streamlines mini-app development by providing a comprehensive toolkit that makes complex Frames SDK interactions intuitive:

- **Simplified Development:** Build apps with minimal knowledge of the Frames SDK
- **Coinbase Wallet Integration:** Access Coinbase Wallet-specific hooks
- **Component Compatibility:** Use [OnchainKit](https://onchainkit.xyz/) components out of the box with MiniKit
- **Automatic Setup:** CLI tool for quick project scaffolding with webhooks and notifications
- **Account Association:** Simplified generation of account associations

## Use Cases

- Gaming mini apps
- Social mini apps
- Payment mini apps
- And many more possibilities!

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started with MiniKit is to use the CLI to bootstrap a new project:

```bash
npx create-onchain --mini
```

This command will:

1. Set up a new project with both frontend and backend components
2. Configure webhooks and notifications
3. Set up account association generation
4. Create a demo app showcasing onchain abilities using OnchainKit

After running the command, follow the prompts to configure your project.

:::info
We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy your MiniKit app, as it integrates seamlessly with the upstash/redis backend required for frames, webhooks, and notifications. The CLI will guide you through setting up the necessary environment variables for your Redis database.
:::

## Provider

The `MiniKitProvider` wraps your application and provides global access to the SDK's context. It handles initialization, events, and automatically applies client safeAreaInsets to ensure your app doesn't overlap parent application elements.

```tsx
import { MiniKitProvider } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit';

function App({ children }) {
  return (
    <MiniKitProvider
      projectId="your-project-id"
      notificationProxyUrl="/api/notification"
    >
      {children}
    </MiniKitProvider>
  );
}
```

### Props

The `MiniKitProvider` accepts the following props:

```tsx
export type MiniKitProviderReact = {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  notificationProxyUrl?: string;
  ...OnchainKitProviderProps
};
```

- `children`: React components to be wrapped by the provider
- `notificationProxyUrl`: Optional URL to override the default `/api/notification` proxy
- All props from `OnchainKitProvider` are also supported

The provider sets up wagmi and react-query providers automatically. It configures connectors to use the Farcaster connector if `sdk.context` is set, with a fallback to CoinbaseWallet. This allows the same application to run both in frames and as a standalone application.

## Hooks

MiniKit provides several utility hooks that wrap the SDK functionality, making it easy to access different features.

### useMiniKit

This hook handles initialization of the application and provides access to the SDK context.

```tsx
const { setFrameReady, isFrameReady, context, updateClientContext, notificationProxyUrl } = useMiniKit();

// Call setFrameReady() when your app is ready to be shown
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isFrameReady) {
    setFrameReady();
  }
}, [isFrameReady, setFrameReady]);
```

**Returns:**

```tsx
{
  ready: () => Promise<MiniKitContextType>; // Removes splash screen and shows the application
  isReady: boolean; // Whether the app is ready to be shown
  context: FrameContext | null; // The current frame context
  updateClientContext: (params: UpdateClientContextParams) => void; // Update client context
  notificationProxyUrl: string; // The notification proxy URL
}
```

### useAddFrame

This hook adds a frame to the user's list of frames and returns notification details.

```tsx
const addFrame = useAddFrame();

// Usage
const handleAddFrame = async () => {
  const result = await addFrame();
  if (result) {
    console.log('Frame added:', result.url, result.token);
  }
};
```

**Returns:**

```tsx
() => Promise<{
  url: string;
  token: string;
} | null>
```

### useNotification

This hook allows sending notifications to users who have added your frame. It requires a token and URL, which are returned when a user adds your frame.

```tsx
const sendNotification = useNotification();

// Usage
const handleSendNotification = () => {
  sendNotification({
    title: 'New High Score!',
    body: 'Congratulations on your new high score!'
  });
};
```

:::info
Notifications require a backend proxy to avoid CORS restrictions. The CLI automatically sets up this proxy at `/api/notification`, but you can override this in the `MiniKitProvider`.
:::

### useOpenUrl

This hook wraps `sdk.actions.openUrl` and falls back to `window.open` when outside a frame context.

```tsx
const openUrl = useOpenUrl();

// Usage
<button onClick={() => openUrl('https://example.com')}>Visit Website</button>
```

### useClose

This hook wraps the `sdk.actions.close` functionality.

```tsx
const close = useClose();

// Usage
<button onClick={close}>Close</button>
```

### usePrimaryButton

This hook accepts primary button options and a callback which will be called on click.

```tsx
usePrimaryButton(
  { text: 'Submit Score' },
  () => {
    // Handle button click
    submitScore();
  }
);
```

### useViewProfile

This hook wraps `sdk.actions.viewProfile`, accepting an FID but falling back to the client's FID.

```tsx
const viewMyProfile = useViewProfile(); // Uses client's FID
const viewUserProfile = useViewProfile(123456); // Uses specified FID

// Usage
<button onClick={viewMyProfile}>View My Profile</button>
<button onClick={viewUserProfile}>View User Profile</button>
```

### useAuthenticate

This hook allows users to sign in with Farcaster. It wraps the SDK's signIn message, adding a default nonce and verification.

```tsx
const { signIn } = useAuthenticate();

// Usage
const handleSignIn = async () => {
  const result = await signIn({
    domain: 'your-domain.com',
    siweUri: 'https://your-domain.com/login'
  });

  if (result) {
    // Handle successful authentication
    console.log('Authenticated:', result);
  }
};
```

:::info
Authentication requires additional setup utilizing an auth framework like next/auth or manually integrating session storage and route/component authentication.
:::

## CLI

The MiniKit CLI is the easiest way to get started. It automatically creates a sample application that integrates different parts of the SDK and some OnchainKit components.

```bash
npx create-onchain --mini
```

### Features

The CLI creates an application with:

1. **Frontend and Backend Integration**

   - Complete setup for adding frames, webhooks, and notifications
   - Uses upstash/redis for data storage (compatible with Vercel)
   - Requires users to sign up for an upstash/redis account and add their key and URL to the .env file

   :::info
   The CLI creates both frontend and backend components to support adding frames, webhooks, and notifications. While a frontend-only option was considered, the ability to add frames and handle notifications requires backend support. If you don't need these features, you can easily remove the database and related routes after project creation.
   :::

2. **Account Association Generation**

   - Automatically generates valid account associations
   - Configures the necessary environment variables

3. **.well-known/farcaster.json Configuration**

   - Sets up the required configuration file:

   ```json
   {
     "accountAssociation": {
       "header": "eyJmaWQiOjgxODAyNiwidHlwZSI6ImN1c3RvZHkiLCJrZXkiOiIweDU4YjU1MTNjMzk5OTYzMjU0MjMzMmU0ZTJlRDAyOThFQzFmRjE4MzEifQ",
       "payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiI4MGI2LTI2MDAtMWYxOC0yNGM5LTYxMDUtNS0wLTQtNzA2Lm5ncm9rLWZyZWUuYXBwIn0",
       "signature": "MHhmOGQ1YzQyMmU3ZTZlMWNhMzU1ZmNmN2ZjYzFmYjMyZWRhZmEyNWU1NjJiMzlhYzE4OWNlMmM5ODU3Y2JjZWViNzlkZTk2ZjhiNTc5NzZjMDM2NzM4Y2UwYjhhOGQxZmMyZDFhYzA2NTdiZTU5N2VhZjFhZDE1ODBmMGQyYjJhODFi"
     },
     "frame": {
       "version": "next",
       "name": "MiniKit",
       "iconUrl": "https://onchainkit.xyz/favicon/48x48.png?v4-19-24",
       "splashImageUrl": "https://onchainkit.xyz/favicon/48x48.png?v4-19-24",
       "splashBackgroundColor": "#000000",
       "homeUrl": "https://your-domain.app/minikit"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Notification Proxy**

   - Automatically sets up a proxy route at `/api/notification`
   - Used by the `useNotification` hook when sending notifications

5. **Webhooks**
   - Implements webhooks using the Farcaster key registry contract for verification
   - Allows applications to respond to events such as `FRAME_ADDED`

### Demo Application

The CLI also creates a demo snake game application that showcases:

- Buttons to add the frame and connect your wallet
- High score tracking with attestations using OnchainKit's `<Transaction/>` component
- Score display using OnchainKit's `<Identity/>` components to resolve ENS names
- Notifications for high scores (rate limited to one every 30 seconds)

## Next Steps

Now that you have MiniKit set up, you can:

1. Explore the demo application to understand how the hooks work
2. Customize the application to fit your needs
3. Deploy your application to a hosting provider like Vercel

Enjoy building!
# MiniKit Quickstart

This guide shows you how to get started with MiniKit, the easist way to build mini apps on Base! It can also be used to update an exisitng standalone app to a mini app. We'll start by setting up the template project with the CLI tool and then explore both built-in and additional features of MiniKit.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin developing with MiniKit, you'll need:

1. **Farcaster Account**: Create an account on [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/) to test and deploy your Mini Apps.

2. **Coinbase Developer Platform Account** (Optional): Sign up for a [Coinbase Developer Platform](https://www.coinbase.com/en-nl/developer-platform) account if you need CDP API key for additional functionalities.

## What is a Mini App?

A mini app is a lightweight web app that runs directly inside [Farcaster Frames](https://docs.farcaster.xyz/developers/frames/v2/), without needing to open a browser or download anything. Built using familiar tools like Next.js and minikit, mini apps behave just like normal apps — but launch instantly from posts, making them feel native to the Farcaster experience.

## Initial Setup

:::steps

## Create a new MiniKit project using the CLI:

```bash
npx create-onchain --mini
```

## When prompted, enter your CDP Client API key.

You can get a CDP API key by going to the (CDP Portal)[portal.cdp.coinbase.com] and navigating API Keys -> Client API Key.

## Skip Frames Account Manifest Setup

You will be asked if you'd like to set up your manifest. You can skip the manifest setup step as we'll handle that separately once we know our project's URL.

## Navigate to your project directory and install dependencies:

```bash [Terminal]
cd your-project-name
npm install
npm run dev
```

:::

## Testing Your Mini App

To test your Mini App in Warpcast, you'll need a live URL.

We recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to deploy your MiniKit app, as it integrates seamlessly with the upstash/redis backend required for stateful frames, webhooks, and notifications.

Alternatively, you can use ngrok to tunnel your localhost to a live url.
::::details[Using ngrok]

:::warning[Pitfalls]
To successfully test your app, you'll need the paid version of ngrok. The free veresion has an approval screen which can break the frame manifest. Also the url for the free version will change every time requiring you to update the manifest each time you start a new ngrok tunnel.
:::

1. Start your development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run dev
```

2. Install and start ngrok to create a tunnel to your local server:

```bash [Terminal]
# Install ngrok if you haven't already
npm install -g ngrok

# Create a tunnel to your local server (assuming it's running on port 3000)
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok (e.g. `https://your-tunnel.ngrok.io`)

4. Visit [Warpcast Frames Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames)

5. In the "Preview Frames" section, paste your ngrok URL to test your mini app.

::::

### Deploying to Vercel

:::steps

#### Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`

#### Deploy with the command: `vercel`

#### Set environment variables in your Vercel project settings (you can use `vercel env add` to set these up via CLI):

- NEXT_PUBLIC_CDP_CLIENT_API_KEY (from [CDP Portal](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com))
- NEXT_PUBLIC_URL (deployed app URL)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGE_URL (optional)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_IMAGE_URL (optional)
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_BACKGROUND_COLORs

:::

You can now test your mini app:

1. Copy your deployed vercel URL
2. Visit [Warpcast Frames Developer Tools](https://warpcast.com/~/developers/frames) on web or mobile
3. Paste URL into "Preview Frames"
4. Tap Launch

## Exploring Built-in Features

The template comes with several pre-implemented features. Let's explore where they are and how they work.

### MiniKitProvider

The `MiniKitProvider` is set up in your `providers.tsx` file. It wraps your application to handle initialization, events, and automatically applie client safeAreaInsets to ensure your app doesn't overlap parent application elements.

```tsx [app/providers.tsx]
import { MiniKitProvider } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit';

export function Providers(props: { children: ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <MiniKitProvider
      apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY}
      chain={base}
      config={{
        appearance: {
          mode: 'auto',
          theme: 'snake',
          name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME,
          logo: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ICON_URL,
        },
      }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </MiniKitProvider>
  );
}
```

The MiniKitProvider also sets up your wagmi and react-query providers automatically, elimintaing that initial setup work.

### useMiniKit

The `useMiniKit` hook is implemented in your main page component (`app/page.tsx`). It handles initialization of the frame and provides access to the SDK context.

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
const { setFrameReady, isFrameReady, context } = useMiniKit();

// The setFrameReady() function is called when your mini-app is ready to be shown
useEffect(() => {
    if (!isFrameReady) {
      setFrameReady();
    }
  }, [setFrameReady, isFrameReady]);
```

### Creating the Manifest

The Frame Manifest is required in order for users to save the frame to their account. This means its also required to send notifications to the user. We initially skipped this step when setting up the app. Now that we know our vercel url, we can configure our manifest.

To set up the manifest, run the following in your Terminal

```bash [Terminal]
npx create-onchain --manifest
```

Enter `y` to proceed with the setup and your browser will open to the following page:

<img
  alt="Manifest Setup"
  src="/images/minikit/manifest-setup.png"
  height="364"
/>

The wallet that you connect must be your Farcaster custody wallet. You can import this wallet to your prefered wallet using the recovery phrase. You can find your recovery phrase in the Warpcast app under Settings -> Advanced -> Farcster recovery phrase.

Once connected, add the vercel url and sign the manifest. This will automatically update your .env variables locally, but we'll need to update Vercel's .env variables.

Create the following new .env variables in your vercel instance and paste the value you see in your local.env file

- FARCASTER_HEADER
- FARCASTER_PAYLOAD
- FARCASTER_SIGNATURE

Now that the manifest is correctly set up, the Save Frame button in the template app should work. We'll explore that below.

### useAddFrame

The `useAddFrame` hook is used to add your mini app to the user's list of mini apps. It's implemented in your main page component and displays a button in the top right allowing the user to add the mini app to their list.

When a user adds the mini app, it returns a url and token, which is used for sending the user notifications. For this walkthrough we'll simply console.log those results to use them later when setting up notifications.

```tsx [app/page.tsx]

const addFrame = useAddFrame()

// Usage in a button click handler
const handleAddFrame = async () => {
  const result = await addFrame()
  if (result) {
    console.log('Frame added:', result.url, result.token)
  }
}
```

:::warning[Not for Production]
In production, you'll want to save the url and token associated with each user in a persistent database so that you can send them notifications over time.
:::

### useOpenUrl

The `useOpenUrl` hook is used to open external URLs from within the frame. In the template, its used in the footer button which links to the MiniKit page.

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
const openUrl = useOpenUrl()

// Usage in a button click handler
<button onClick={() => openUrl('https://example.com')}>
  Visit Website
</button>

// Then in the return function
<footer className="absolute bottom-4 flex items-center w-screen max-w-[520px] justify-center">
  <button
    type="button"
    className="mt-4 ml-4 px-2 py-1 flex justify-start rounded-2xl font-semibold opacity-40 border border-black text-xs"
    onClick={() => openUrl('https://base.org/builders/minikit')}
    >
    BUILT ON BASE WITH MINIKIT
  </button>
</footer>
```

Now that we've reviewed the MiniKit teamplate and the functionality already implemented, lets add some additional MiniKit features.

## Additional MiniKit Features

Now, let's implement additional hooks provided by the MiniKit library. We'll add these features one by one.

### `useClose`

First, let's add the ability to close the frame from within the interface:

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
// Add useClose to the import list
import { useMinikit, useAddFrame, useOpenUrl, useClose } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit'

// Add the hook
const close = useClose()

// Add the button in the header right after the `saveFrameButton`
<div className="pr-1 justify-end">
  {saveFrameButton}
  <button
    type="button"
    className="cursor-pointer bg-transparent font-semibold text-sm pl-2""
    onClick={close}
    >
    CLOSE
  </button>
</div>
```

If you reload the frame in the Warpcast dev tools preview, you'll now see the close button in the top right.

### `usePrimaryButton`

The Primary Button is a button that always exists at the bottom of the frame. Its good for managing global state which is relevant throughout your mini app.

For the template example, we'll use the Priamry Button to Pause and Restart the game. The game state is managed within the `snake.tsx` component, and we can easily add the `usePrimaryButton` hook there since the MiniKit hooks are available throughout the app.

```tsx [/app/components/snake.tsx]
// add an import for usePrimaryButton
import {usePrimaryButton } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit'

// game state already exists, so we'll leverage that below.
usePrimaryButton(
  {text: gameState == GameState.RUNNING ? 'PAUSE GAME' : 'START GAME'},
  () => {
    setGameState(gameState == GameState.RUNNING ? GameState.PAUSED : GameState.RUNNING);
  }
)
```

You'll notice that adding the Primary button takes up space at the bottom of the frame, which causes the "BUILT ON BASE WITH MINIKIT" button to move upwards and overlap with the contorls.
We can quickly fix that by changing the text to "BUILT WITH MINIKIT" and removing the `ml-4` style in the `className` of the `<button>`

### `useViewProfile`

Now, let's add profile viewing capability. The useViewProfile hook allows you to define what profile to use by defining the user's FID, which is great for social applications. If you don't define an FID, it defaults to the client FID.

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
import { useViewProfile } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit'

// Add the hook
const viewProfile = useViewProfile()

// Add the handler function
const handleViewProfile = () => {
  viewProfile()
}

// Add the button in your UI in the header after the close button
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={handleViewProfile}
  className="cursor-pointer bg-transparent font-semibold text-sm pl-2
>
  PROFILE
</button>
```

### `useNotification`

One of the major benefits of mini apps is that you can send notifications to your users through their socail app.

Recall the token and url we saved in the [useAddFrame section](docs.base.org/builderkits/minikit/quickstart#useaddframe)? We'll use those now to send a user a notification. In this guide, we'll simply send a test notification unrelated to the game activity.

```tsx [app/page.tsx]
//add useNotification to the import list
import {..., useNotification } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit'

// Add the hook
const sendNotification = useNotification()

// Add the handler function
const handleSendNotification = async () => {
  try {
    await sendNotification({
      title: 'New High Score! 🎉',
      body: 'Congratulations on achieving a new high score!'
    })
    setTimeout(() => setNotificationSent(false), 30000)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to send notification:', error)
  }
}

// Add the button in your UI
{context?.client.added && (
  <button
    type="button"
    onClick={handleSendNotification}
    className="cursor-pointer bg-transparent font-semibold text-sm disabled:opacity-50"
  >
    SEND NOTIFICATION
  </button>
)}
```

:::info
Notice that we first check if the user has added the frame to their list of mini apps before displaying the button. This is using the `context` object provided by `useMiniKit()`. If you don't see the button to send the notification, its likely because mini app hasn't been saved.
:::

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you've created your first mini app, set up the manifest, added key MiniKit hooks, and sent your users a notification! We're excited to see what you build with MiniKit!
