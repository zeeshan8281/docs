Using a snapshot significantly reduces the initial time required to sync a Base node. Snapshots are updated regularly.

<Warning>
Geth Archive Nodes are no longer supported via snapshots due to performance limitations. For Archive functionality, please use Reth.
</Warning>

If you're a prospective or current Base node operator, you can restore from a snapshot to speed up your initial sync. Follow the steps below carefully.

## Restoring from Snapshot

These steps assume you are in the cloned `node` directory (the one containing `docker-compose.yml`).

1. **Prepare Data Directory**:
    - **Before running Docker for the first time**, create the data directory on your host machine that will be mapped into the Docker container. This directory must match the `volumes` mapping in the `docker-compose.yml` file for the client you intend to use.  
      - For Reth (recommended):  
        ```bash
        mkdir ./reth-data
        ```  
      - For Geth:  
        ```bash
        mkdir ./geth-data
        ```  
    - If you have previously run the node and have an existing data directory, **stop the node** (`docker compose down`), remove the _contents_ of the existing directory (e.g. `rm -rf ./reth-data/*`), and proceed.

2. **Download Snapshot**: Choose the appropriate snapshot for your network and client from the table below. Use `wget` (or similar) to download it into the `node` directory.

    | Network  | Client | Snapshot Type | Download Command (`wget â€¦`)                                                                                       |
    | -------- | ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Testnet  | Reth   | Archive (recommended)| `wget https://sepolia-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://sepolia-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/latest)` |
    | Testnet  | Reth   | Full                 | Coming Soon                 |
    | Testnet  | Geth   | Full                 | `wget https://sepolia-full-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://sepolia-full-snapshots.base.org/latest)`             |
    | Mainnet  | Reth   | Archive (recommended)| `wget https://mainnet-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://mainnet-reth-archive-snapshots.base.org/latest)` |
    | Testnet  | Reth   | Full                 | Coming Soon                 |
    | Mainnet  | Geth   | Full                 | `wget https://mainnet-full-snapshots.base.org/$(curl https://mainnet-full-snapshots.base.org/latest)`             |

    <Note>
    Ensure you have enough free disk space to download the snapshot archive (`.tar.gz` file) _and_ extract its contents. The extracted data will be significantly larger than the archive.
    </Note>

3. **Extract Snapshot**: Untar the downloaded snapshot archive. Replace `<snapshot-filename.tar.gz>` with the actual downloaded filename:

    ```bash
    tar -xzvf <snapshot-filename.tar.gz>
    ```

4. **Move Data**: The extraction process will likely create a directory (e.g., `reth` or `geth`). 

    * Move the *contents* of that directory into the data directory you created in Step 1.
        * Example (if archive extracted to a reth folder - **verify actual folder name**):

          ```bash
          # For Reth
          mv ./reth/* ./reth-data/
          rm -rf ./reth    # Clean up empty extracted folder
          ```

        * Example (if archive extracted to a geth folder):

          ```bash
          # For Geth
          mv ./geth/* ./geth-data/
          rm -rf ./geth    # Clean up empty extracted folder
          ```

    * The goal is to have the chain data directories (e.g., `chaindata`, `nodes`, `segments`, etc.) directly inside `./reth-data` or `./geth-data`, not nested within another subfolder.

5. **Start the Node**: Now that the snapshot data is in place, return the root of your Base node folder and start the node:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    docker compose up --build
    ```

  Your node should begin syncing from the last block in the snapshot.

6. **Verify and Clean Up**: Monitor the node logs (`docker compose logs -f <service_name>`) or use the [sync monitoring](/base-chain/node-operators/run-a-base-node#syncing) command to ensure the node starts syncing from the snapshot's block height. Once confirmed, you can safely delete the downloaded snapshot archive (`.tar.gz` file) to free up disk space.
