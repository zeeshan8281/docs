description: A tutorial that teaches how to set up and run a Base Node.
---

This tutorial will walk you through setting up your own [Base Node](https://github.com/base-org/node).

## Objectives

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:

- Deploy and sync a Base node

## Prerequisites

<Warning>
Running a node is time consuming, resource expensive, and potentially costly. If you don't already know why you want to run your own node, you probably don't need to.

If you're just getting started and need an RPC URL, you can use our free endpoints:

- **Mainnet**: `https://mainnet.base.org`
- **Testnet (Sepolia)**: `https://sepolia.base.org`

**Note:** Our RPCs are rate-limited, they are not suitable for production apps.

If you're looking to harden your app and avoid rate-limiting for your users, please consider using an endpoint from one of our [partners](/base-chain/tools/node-providers).
</Warning>


### Hardware requirements

We recommend you have this configuration to run a node:

- 8-Core CPU
- at least 16 GB RAM
- a locally attached NVMe SSD drive
- adequate storage capacity to accommodate both the snapshot restoration process (if restoring from snapshot) and chain data, ensuring a minimum of (2 \* current_chain_size) + snapshot_size + 20%\_buffer

<Note>
If utilizing Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), ensure timing buffered disk reads are fast enough in order to avoid latency issues alongside the rate of new blocks added to Base during the initial synchronization process; `io2 block express` is recommended.
</Note>


### Docker

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and have it running on your machine.

### L1 RPC URL

You'll need your own L1 RPC URL. This can be one that you run yourself, or via a third-party provider, such as our [partners].

## Running a Node

1. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/base-org/node).
2. Ensure you have an Ethereum L1 full node RPC available (not Base), and set `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC` & `OP_NODE_L1_BEACON` (in the `.env.*` file if using `docker-compose`). If running your own L1 node, it needs to be synced before Base will be able to fully sync.
3. Uncomment the line relevant to your network (`.env.sepolia`, or `.env.mainnet`) under the 2 `env_file` keys in `docker-compose.yml`.
4. Run `docker compose up`. Confirm you get a response from:

```bash Terminal
curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
```

<Warning>
Syncing your node may take **days** and will consume a vast amount of your requests quota. Be sure to monitor usage and up your plan if needed.
</Warning>

### Snapshots

<Note>
Geth Archive Nodes are no longer supported. For Archive functionality, use Reth, which provides significantly better performance in Baseâ€™s high-throughput environment.
</Note>

If you're a Base Node operator and would like to save significant time on the initial sync, you may [restore from a snapshot](/base-chain/node-operators/snapshots#restoring-from-snapshot). The snapshots are updated every week.

### Syncing

You can monitor the progress of your sync with:

```bash Terminal
echo Latest synced block behind by: $((($(date +%s)-$( \
  curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545 | \
  jq -r .result.unsafe_l2.timestamp))/60)) minutes
```

You'll also know that the sync hasn't completed if you get `Error: nonce has already been used` if you try to deploy using your node.
