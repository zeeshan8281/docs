This page outlines the purpose, goals, structure, and responsibilities of the
Security Council for Base. The Council is composed of individuals and
organizations who hold signing keys and help manage upgrades to keep the Base
network secure.

## Purpose

Base’s mission is to build a global onchain economy that increases innovation,
creativity, and freedom. We believe this is only possible on a decentralized
platform. This is why Base is (1) built on Ethereum, the most secure and
decentralized L1, (2) built on the open and permissionless OP Stack, and (3)
upholds key [Neutrality Principles](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbases-neutrality-principles-for-base).

As part of our ongoing commitment to decentralization, Base launched
[permissionless fault proofs](https://base.mirror.xyz/eOsedW4tm8MU5OhdGK107A9wsn-aU7MAb8f3edgX5Tk) in
October 2024, [decentralized control of contract upgrades](https://base.mirror.xyz/tWDMlGp48fF0MeADcLQruUBq1Qxkou4O5x3ax8Rm3jA) via a Security Council
in April 2025, and has now reached Stage 1 Decentralization.

In reaching **Stage 1**, Base provides stronger security guarantees and fewer
trust assumptions. Builders benefit from infrastructure certainty (no unexpected
rule changes), and there’s no single point of failure—everyone can participate
in verifying and securing the network.

## Structure

**Composition and quorum**

Stage 1 Decentralization requirements say that the group which approves Base
Chain contract upgrades must contain:

- at least 8 participants
- a ≥75% quorum
- a quorum-blocking group outside the main rollup operator (Base)

In addition to the current signing entities (Optimism and Coinbase), the
Security Council adds 10 independent entities and individuals from
geographically diverse regions. To satisfy the ≥75% quorum, 9 out of the 12
entities (the 10 entities in the Security Council, Optimism, and Coinbase) are
required to approve Base upgrades. Base upgrades cannot take effect until a
quorum of these entities sign and approve the upgrade. This composition
satisfies all requirements.

**Member Selection criteria**

- Representation across diverse geographic regions and international territories
- Strong alignment with [Base’s mission and values](https://base.mirror.xyz/jjQnUq_UNTQOk7psnGBFOsShi7FlrRp8xevQUipG_Gk)
- Diverse organizations - each member represents a separate entity
- Proven track record in the Base and Ethereum ecosystem - in good standing in upholding professional and ethical standards in the community
- Technical competency and good security practices - has completed screening processes, including background checks, and have shown ability to securely store and use sensitive key materials

**Member Terms**

The Security Council for Base operates on a staggered “cohort” model:

- Cohort 1: 6-month term beginning April 2025
- Cohort 2: 9-month term beginning April 2025

## Roles & Responsibilities

**Review and approve changes**

- Council members are notified about proposed upgrades, and they must verify, approve, and sign these upgrades.
- Council members must verify, approve and sign role changes (in case of key rotations for lost devices, member rotations, etc.). Any key rotations will not disrupt quorum or security.

**Maintain availability and lines of communication**

- Be accessible and reachable for scheduled signings, coordination calls, and emergencies.
- Collaborate with other members to resolve urgent issues.

**Preserve key security**

- Generate and store key materials securely.
- Keys should only be used for activities which directly relate to the Security Council member role (upgrades and ownership changes).
- Report suspected loss of access or compromise immediately.
- Undergo onchain safety and security training at the beginning of each term.
- At regular intervals, participate in a liveness check by signing a message, to confirm ongoing control of the key.

**Act in good faith**

- Avoid conflicts of interest and disclose potential conflicts.
- Participate in removing or replacing dysfunctional signers without compromising security.

## The future

The Security Council for Base is a critical step toward a more decentralized,
resilient, and secure future for the Base network. By distributing key
responsibilities across trusted, independent participants and implementing fault
proofs, we’ve reduced reliance on any single entity while strengthening
guarantees for users, builders, and the broader ecosystem.

This is just the beginning. As Base continues to evolve, the role of the
Security Council will be progressively minimized, paving the way for even more
trustless infrastructure beyond Stage 1—Stage 2—and even greater community
control.

Our mission remains the same: to build a global onchain economy that empowers
innovation, creativity, and freedom—on a foundation that everyone can rely on.

Base is for everyone.
