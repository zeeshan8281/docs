## What is transaction finality?

Finality refers to the point at which a transaction sent to Base becomes irreversible. This provides guarantees that the transaction will not be rolled back or lost.

Finality works differently for normal transactions that modify Base L2 state than it does for transactions that withdraw funds from Base L2 to Ethereum L1.

<Note>
**Only transactions that withdraw funds from Base to Ethereum must wait 7 days.** Regular transactions within Base, such as swaps or sends, _do not_ have a 7 day finality time.
</Note>


## Finality for Base L2 Transactions
This describes finality for transactions on Base except withdrawals transactions that move funds from Base to Ethereum L1

For transactions on Base, finality is not a single point in time to wait for. Instead, there are 4 stages in time that each provide increasing security guarantees:

<Steps>
<Step title="Flashblock Inclusion: ~200ms" titleSize="h3">
After roughly 200ms, the transaction is included in a preconfirmation block (Flashblock) by the Base sequencer.
<Accordion title="Under 0.001% probability of a reorg.">
* Flashblocks reorg less than 0.001% of the time
* You can see the reorg history here:

</Step>
<Step title="L2 Block Inclusion: ~2s" titleSize="h3">
After roughly 2 seconds, the sequencer has built the transaction into an L2 block and distributed it to validator nodes.
<Accordion title="Near 0% probability of a reorg.">
* Only a single Base L2 block has every reorged, representing .0000003% of transactions
</Accordion>
</Step>

<Step title="L1 Batch Inclusion: ~2m" titleSize="h3">
After roughly 2 minutes, a Base batch containing the transaction has been posted to Ethereum.
<Accordion title="Effectively 0% probability of a reorg.">
* There have been no reorgs of L2 blocks that were batched to Ethereum L1.
</Accordion>

</Step>
<Step title="L1 Batch Finality: ~20m" titleSize="h3">
The Ethereum L1 batch contiining the transaction is older than 2 epochs, or 64 L1 blocks. It now has 
<Accordion title="Effectively 0% probability of a reorg.">
* There have been no reorgs of L2 blocks that were finalized on Ethereum L1.

</Step>
</Steps>


These stages can be visualized over time like this:

## Finality for Withdrawal Transactions
This describes finality of transactions that move funds from Base to Ethereum

**Only withdrawals must wait 7 days to finalize before the funds are released to the address on Ethereum L1.** This allows the Base Fault Proof system to provide extremely high security guarantees for funds bridged to Base.

<Accordion title="What happens during the 7 days?">
When a transaction initiates a withdrawal from Base to Ethereum, the funds are removed from the account balance on Base. Later, a permissionless “proposer” must tell Ethereum that Base contains this withdrawal, which initiates the process for the funds to be credited to the address on Ethereum.

However, Ethereum cannot natively confirm what happened on Base as they are separate blockchains. Thus, there is a 7 day window in which a permissionless “challenger” can dispute a proposal that it feels is malicious. If no challenge is made in the 7 days, the withdrawal finalizes. If a challenge is made, the proposer and challenger play out what is called the Fault Dispute Game, which requires bonds to be staked for one side to win.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="If there is a reorg on Ethereum, will it cause a reorg on Base?">
In almost all circumstances, no. The Base sequencer and validator nodes make decisions based on a configurable delay from the tip of the Ethereum chain. In the extreme case of a large Ethereum reorg, they can downgrade safe blocks to unsafe blocks without data loss. Then, as the Base sequencer re-submits batch data to Ethereum, unsafe blocks become safe ones transparently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do deposit transactions take to finalize?">
Transactions moving funds from Ethereum to Base must be initiated on Ethereum. They typically get included within 3 minutes by the Base sequencer and proceed through the safe, unsafe, and finalized stages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do successful challenges of output proposals cause the chain to reorg?">
No. The Fault Proofs system only controls the validity of withdrawals finalizing on Ethereum. It does not trigger reorgs on the L2 chain.
