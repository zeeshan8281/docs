## DipDup
[DipDup](https://dipdup.io) is a Python framework for building smart contract indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://dipdup.io/docs/supported-networks/base) or follow the [quickstart](https://dipdup.io/docs/quickstart-evm) guide.



## Envio

[Envio](https://envio.dev) is a full-featured data indexing solution that provides application developers with a seamless and efficient way to index and aggregate real-time and historical blockchain data for any EVM. The indexed data is easily accessible through custom GraphQL queries, providing developers with the flexibility and power to retrieve specific information.

Envio [HyperSync](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/hypersync) is an indexed layer of the Base blockchain for the hyper-speed syncing of historical data (JSON-RPC bypass). What would usually take hours to sync ~100,000 events can now be done in the order of less than a minute.

Designed to optimize the user experience, Envio offers automatic code generation, flexible language support, multi-chain data aggregation, and a reliable, cost-effective hosted service.

To get started, visit the [documentation](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/overview) or follow the [quickstart](https://docs.envio.dev/docs/quickstart) guide.

## Nexandria

[Nexandria](https://www.nexandria.com/?utm_source=base-docs&utm_medium=partner-docs) API offers access to complete historical on-chain data at blazing speeds, arbitrary granularity (as low as block-level) and at viable unit economics (think web2 level costs). Our technology lets you generate subgraphs on the fly, unlocking unique endpoints like a statement of all the balance transfers for all the tokens, or a list of all the neighbors of an address with all the historical interaction details or a portfolio balance graph covering all the tokens across arbitrary time/block ranges.
