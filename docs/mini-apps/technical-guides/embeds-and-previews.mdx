## Why Sharing Matters

Sharing is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways to grow your Mini App user base.

When a user shares your app into a feed (such as Base App or Farcaster), the platform generates a **rich embed** — a visual preview complete with your branding, imagery, and call-to-action button that appears directly in social feeds.

Every share:

- **Increases reach** — friends and followers see your app instantly
- **Drives engagement** — visually compelling embeds get more clicks than plain links  
- **Improves ranking** — shared apps are more likely to appear in category leaderboards
- **Creates viral loops** — great experiences encourage users to share with their networks

## Metadata and Embeds

### How Metadata Creates Embeds

When someone shares your Mini App link, platforms like Base App don't just show a plain URL. Instead, they fetch **metadata** from your page and use it to generate a rich **embed** — a visual preview card with your image, title, and call-to-action button.

The metadata acts as instructions that tell the platform exactly how to display your Mini App in feeds.

**The complete metadata-to-embed process:**

<Steps>
<Step title="User shares your link">
  User clicks share or pastes your Mini App URL into a social feed (Base App, Farcaster).
</Step>

<Step title="Platform fetches metadata">
  The platform makes a request to your URL and reads the `<meta>` tags in your HTML to understand how to display your app.
</Step>

<Step title="Metadata becomes embed">
  Platform transforms your metadata into a rich visual embed with image, title, description, and interactive button.
</Step>

<Step title="Embed appears in feed">
  Your Mini App appears as an attractive, clickable card that users can launch directly from their feed.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Metadata Structure

Your metadata consists of specific HTML meta tags that define each part of the embed:

```html index.html
<meta name="fc:frame" content='{
  "version":"next",
  "imageUrl":"https://your-app.com/embed-image",
  "button":{
    "title":"Play Now",
    "action":{
      "type":"launch_frame",
      "name":"Your App Name",
      "url":"https://your-app.com"
    }
  }
}' />
```

Each piece of metadata directly corresponds to a visual element in the embed:

- `imageUrl` → The main visual that appears in the embed
- `button.title` → Text on the call-to-action button  
- `action.name` → App name displayed in the embed
- `action.url` → Where users go when they click the embed

### Embed Appearance in Feeds

</Frame>

### Manifest vs Embed Metadata

Your Mini App uses two types of metadata:

#### Manifest file

Purpose: App registration and discovery

Located at `/.well-known/farcaster.json`, this file contains your app's basic information for Base App's directory.

<Warning>
Mini Apps require a complete manifest. Read the [manifest requirements](/mini-apps/features/manifest#example-manifest).
</Warning>

#### Embed metadata

Purpose: Embed generation when shared

Located in your HTML `<head>` tags, this metadata creates the rich embeds when users share your app.

```html index.html
<meta name="fc:frame" content='{
  "version":"next",
  "imageUrl":"https://your-app.com/embed-image",
  "button":{
    "title":"Play Now",
    "action":{
      "type":"launch_frame",
      "name":"Your App Name",
      "url":"https://your-app.com"
    }
  }
}' />
```

This controls how your embeds appear in social feeds.

### Best Practices for Metadata

- Image optimization: Use 3:2 aspect ratio
- Clear value proposition in button and text
- Visual consistency with product UI
- Fast loading for metadata endpoints
- Validate across platforms pre‑launch

## Sharing

### Adding Share Functionality 

Prompt users to share during key accomplishment moments using MiniKit’s compose hook.

```ts ComposeCastButton.tsx
import { useComposeCast } from '@coinbase/onchainkit/minikit';

export default function ComposeCastButton() {
  const { composeCast } = useComposeCast();

  const handleCompose = () => {
    composeCast({
      text: 'Just minted an awesome NFT using @coinbase OnchainKit! ',
    });
  };

  const handleComposeWithEmbed = () => {
    composeCast({
      text: 'Check out this amazing Mini App!',
      embeds: ['https://your-mini-app-url.com'],
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleCompose}>Share Achievement</button>
      <button onClick={handleComposeWithEmbed}>Share Frame</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Tip>
Strategic sharing moments:

- After completing a quiz
- After minting an NFT
- After beating a challenge
- After reaching a milestone
</Tip>

### From the Base App UI

Users can also share directly from your app's detail view in the Base app through the built‑in share functionality.

<Frame caption="Share button in the Base app UI">
  <img src="/images/minikit/share-button-ui.jpg" alt="Share button in Base app" className="h-[220px] w-auto"/>
</Frame>

## Embed Types

### Static embeds

Use a single, unchanging image and text for all shares. Best for consistency and speed.

### Dynamic embeds

Generate metadata per user or event for personalization and FOMO. Ensure fast response (< 5s) and caching strategy.

## Implementation

### With MiniKit (Next.js)

```ts layout.tsx
export async function generateMetadata(): Promise<Metadata> {
  const URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_URL;
  return {
    title: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME,
    description: "Your Mini App description here",
    other: {
      "fc:frame": JSON.stringify({
        version: "next",
        imageUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_HERO_IMAGE,
        button: {
          title: `Launch ${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME}`,
          action: {
            type: "launch_frame",
            name: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_PROJECT_NAME,
            url: URL,
            splashImageUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_IMAGE,
            splashBackgroundColor: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLASH_BACKGROUND_COLOR,
          },
        },
      }),
    },
  };
}
```

### Without MiniKit

```html index.html
<meta name="fc:frame" content='{"version":"next","imageUrl":"https://your-app.com/embed-image","button":{"title":"Play Now","action":{"type":"launch_frame","name":"Your App Name","url":"https://your-app.com"}}}' />
```

## Debugging

### Tools

<Card title="Base Build Preview Tool" icon="bug" href="https://base.dev/preview">
  Test how your app will appear in the Base app by validating your manifest, embeds, and account association
</Card>

### Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Embed not showing or incorrect">
Check image dimensions, required `fc:frame`, JSON validity, and URL accessibility.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Embeds not updating">
Review cache headers, repost to refresh, wait ~10–15 minutes for caches.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Slow generation">
Optimize image generation, pre‑generate, use serverless, compress assets.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Set `Cache-Control` carefully: long enough for performance (300–600s), short enough for quick updates.
</Warning>
