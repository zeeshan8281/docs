## Load Time 

* Apps should load within **3 seconds**, and in-app actions should complete within **1 second**.  
* Always show a **loading indicator** when an action is in progress.

## Onboarding Flow 

* When a user opens your mini app for the first time, they should see a brief, informative screen explaining what the mini app does and how to get started. Keep this limited to 3 screens, and use succinct language and images. 

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img
    src="/images/bolero.jpg"
    alt="Bolero onboarding flow"
    style={{ height: 450, width: 'auto', maxWidth: '100%' }}
  />
  <div style={{ fontSize: 14, color: '#6b7280' }}><a href="https://www.boleromusic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example onboarding flow</a></div>

## User Information & Privacy

* Only ask for personal information when absolutely necessary. Give users context and explain the value of using the app **before** asking for private information.   
* Always explain why the information is needed. Respect user privacy and data minimization principles.

## User Profile

* Show the user’s profile somewhere on the screen, and include their avatar and username used on the Base app  
* **Avoid showing 0x addresses in your mini app.**

## App Description 

* Your mini app should have a clear, simple value proposition that makes sense to anyone.   
* Describe what your app does and why it matters in one sentence.   
* **Keep your messaging human, concise, and benefit-focused.**

***Examples**:* “Earn and borrow on your terms”, “Create and share art that lives onchain”

## App Cover Photo 

**Do’s ✅**

* Include a high-quality cover image that feels trustworthy and engaging.  
* Ensure no typos or visual clutter in the image.

**Don’ts ❌**

* **Follow icon specs**  
  * Size: **1024×1024px**  
  * Format: **PNG (no alpha transparency)**  
  * Defined via `iconUrl` in `farcaster.json`
