### Display 
See how your mini app is displayed in the Base app in our [Figma specification file](https://www.figma.com/design/4wx6s24NB0KLgprQAyMT8R/TBA-Mini-App-Specs).

### Layout 

* Keep core actions visible near the top or middle of the screen ‚Äî not hidden behind scrolls.  
* Limit the number of buttons. Make it obvious what users should do first.  
* Use clear primary calls to action (e.g., ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù, ‚ÄúStart Game‚Äù, ‚ÄúDeposit‚Äù).  
* Design for **small viewports** and **portrait orientation.**  
* **Optimize for thumb reach and one-handed use.**

### Navigation

* Most mini apps should include a **bottom navigation bar**.

    alt="Bottom navigation bar example" 
    className="rounded-lg"
/>

* A side menu can also be an intuitive place to put settings and user profile information.

        className="rounded-lg"
    />

* Always include **labels under icons** so users understand each tab.  
* Test on multiple device sizes to ensure buttons are not cut off.


### Colors

Use color to communicate clearly, express your brand, and create cohesive mini app experiences.

### **Color Palette**

* **Primary:** Brand color for CTAs and key interactions.  
* **Secondary:** Complements primary; use for accents or secondary actions.  
* **Neutral:** For text, backgrounds, and structure with strong contrast.

### **Themes**

* Support **light and dark modes**:  
* Maintain contrast and brand consistency.  
* Respect system preference but allow manual toggle.  
* Use smooth transitions between themes.  
* **üí°Tip:** Use **semantic color tokens** (e.g., `--color-primary`, `--color-background`) with **light/dark theme overrides** for maintainability and flexibility.  


### Typography

* Ensure the fonts you use are easy to read. Our team recommends **Inter.**   
* **Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors** to make reading easy under various lighting conditions.  
* **Stick to regular, bold, and italic as needed.** Decorative or script fonts should be reserved for accents, not body text.

### Spacing

* Groups related elements together.  
* Consistent spacing: Creates visual rhythm and predictability with consistent spacing.  
* Give content room to breathe with white space.  
* Avoid cramped layouts.  
* Base Unit: Start with a base spacing unit (typically **4px** or **8px**) and maintain consistency throughout:  
  * 4px base: More granular control, better for mobile.  
  * 8px base: Easier mental math, good for desktop.  


### Touch Interactions

* Ensure all touch targets are at least **44px**.  
* Support common gestures (tap, swipe, pinch) where appropriate.  
* Don‚Äôt rely on **hover states** ‚Äî they don‚Äôt exist on touch screens.
