This section covers how to build high-quality, successful mini apps for the Base app. Your app should meet all product, design, and technical guidelines and be designed for virality.

<Note>
  To submit your app for featured placement, first verify your mini app in the [Base Build dashboard](https://base.dev/), then fill out the [submission form](https://buildonbase.deform.cc/getstarted/).

  Meeting these guidelines is a prerequisite for featured placement, but ***does not guarantee placement.*** Base holds a very high bar for featured placement.

### Featured placement checklist

Use this checklist to quickly validate your mini app meets the Featured Guidelines. All items are required unless marked “when applicable”.

* Authentication  
  * In-app authentication stays within the Base app with no external redirects.   
  * No email/phone verification inside the app   
  * Allow exploration pre‑sign‑in when possible
* Onboarding flow  
  * Display an educational landing page or carousel explaining the purpose of the app & how to get started   
  * App only requests essential personal information, with clear context  
  * Display user’s avatar and username (**no 0x addresses**)   
* Base compatibility   
  * App is client-agnostic, with no hard-coded Farcaster text or links, or other client-specific behavior  
  * Use neutral wording (e.g., “Share to Feed”) and do not deeplink to other clients for features supported in the Base app  
  * App uses a paymaster for sponsored transactions (Base Paymaster recommended)  
  * Batch sequential actions with EIP‑5792 (when applicable)
* Layout  
  * Key action for users to take is visible and centered on page   
  * App has a bottom navigation bar or side menu to easily access core flow   
  * Include labels under icons; test across device sizes  
* Load time  
  * App loads within **3 seconds**  
  * In-app actions complete within **1 second**  
  * Loading indicators are shown during actions  
* Usability   
  * App supports **light and dark modes** consistently with sufficient contrast  
  * Use semantic color tokens for theming  
  * App has minimum **44px touch targets**  
  * Avoid hover‑only interactions  
* App metadata   
  * App description is clear, concise, and user-focused   
  * Manifest is publicly accessible at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` with required fields (`accountAssociation`, `frame`, `primaryCategory`, `tags`)  
  * Embed metadata implemented; images/text meet size/length constraints  
  * App icon is **1024×1024 px**, PNG, **no transparency**, readable at small sizes and referenced via `iconUrl`  
  * App cover photo is **high quality**, no typos/clutter, **no Base logo**, **no team photos**
* Notifications  
  * Title ≤ 32 chars; body ≤ 128; `targetURL` ≤ 1024 and same domain as the mini app  
  * Respect cadence (well below 1 every 30s, ≤ 100/day); send at relevant times  
  * Track CTR and disabled rates; iterate based on analytics
