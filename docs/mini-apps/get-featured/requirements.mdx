Your app must meet the minimum requirements across three pillars: User Experience, Design, and Technical Excellence.



### User Experience

Your app must provide an intuitive, frictionless experience that allows users to explore and understand value immediately.

**Acceptance criteria**
- All users can explore at least part of the app without authenticating
- Lightweight, optional onboarding or prominent tutorial CTA from the homepage
- Display profile pictures, usernames, and other context data instantly
- Avoid crypto jargon (e.g., "Sign in", not "Connect Wallet")
- Display usernames, not wallet addresses unless necessary
- Plain-language copy that explains benefits, not mechanisms
- Replace client-specific terms with neutral ones

**How to Implement**
- Use the `context` object to make users instantly feel at home with profile pictures, usernames, and other context data
- See [Optimize Onboarding](/mini-apps/growth/optimize-onboarding)
- Provide quick-start steps or a short guided tour


### Design

Your app must follow the Foundations design system to ensure visual consistency and professional quality. Apps with low-resolution icons, broken mobile layouts, or inconsistent styling will be rejected.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Respect mobile safe areas; concise interfaces with clear primary actions
- Legible text, accessible contrast, responsive layouts
- Design for compact, touch-first contexts

**How to Implement**
- [Mobile First](/mini-apps/design-ux/foundations/mobile-first): Design for smallest screens, ensure proper touch target sizing
- [Typography](/mini-apps/design-ux/foundations/typography): Use specified text sizes and line heights
- [Navigation](/mini-apps/design-ux/foundations/navigation):



### Technical Excellence

Your app must meet all technical requirements for metadata, authentication, transactions, and Base integration.

#### Complete Metadata

Metadata includes your manifest and embed metadata. Complete, valid metadata is required for indexing, category placement, and high-quality embeds.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- Manifest is publicly accessible at `/.well-known/farcaster.json` 
- Required fields are present and valid (`accountAssociation`, `frame`, `primaryCategory`, `tags`)
- Images meet size/format constraints; text fields respect length limits

**How to Implement**
- Follow the [Manifest guide](/mini-apps/core-concepts/manifest)
- Implement [embed metadata](/mini-apps/core-concepts/embeds-and-previews#implementation)

<Note>
  Validate your manifest using our preview tools at <a href="https://base.dev/preview">base.dev/preview</a>.
</Note>

#### In-app Authentication

Users must remain in the Base app throughout the authentication flow. Eliminate flows that bounce users out of the Base app.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- No external redirects
- No email / phone verification
- Users can explore before sign-in when possible

**How to Implement**
- Follow the [Authentication guide](/mini-apps/core-concepts/authentication)
- Prefer in-app SIWF/Quick Auth or wallet auth

#### Client-Agnostic

There must be no client-specific behaviors or wording that degrade the experience in the Base app. You must also ensure that you don't redirect the user to another client for functionality supported in the Base app.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Do not hardcode client-specific URLs (e.g., Farcaster-only links)
- Use neutral language in UI (e.g. use "Share to Feed" instead of "Share to Farcaster")
- Eliminate buttons that deeplink to other clients for features supported in the Base app

**How to Implement**
- Update all links according to the [Links](/mini-apps/technical-guides/links) guide
- Review the [Base App Compatibility](/mini-apps/troubleshooting/base-app-compatibility) guide for functionality not supported in the Base app. All other functionality must keep users in the Base app.

#### Gasless

Sponsor transaction fees to remove friction and reduce drop-off for new users. For mini apps on Base, we recommend using the [Base Paymaster](/onchainkit/paymaster/quickstart-guide).

**Acceptance criteria**
- Transactions are sponsored via a paymaster

**How to Implement**
- Recommended: [Base Paymaster](/onchainkit/paymaster/quickstart-guide)

</Note>

#### Batch Transactions (EIP-5792)

Batch sequential actions where applicable to minimize signatures and reduce friction. Use EIP-5792 capabilities to send multiple calls in one request.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Where applicable, combine sequential actions into a single batch (e.g. approve + swap)

**How to Implement**
- See [Batch Transactions](/base-account/improve-ux/batch-transactions)
- Provider APIs: [`wallet_sendCalls`](/base-account/reference/core/provider-rpc-methods/wallet_sendCalls), [`wallet_getCapabilities`](/base-account/reference/core/provider-rpc-methods/wallet_getCapabilities)
