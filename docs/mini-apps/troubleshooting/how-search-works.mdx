title: How Search works
description: If your Mini App isn't appearing in the Base app, this guide explains how indexing and search work so you can identify and fix the issue.
---
Indexing is how The Base app adds your Mini App to its catalog, making it discoverable through search and browsing.
Unlike traditional app stores with manual submission, you control when indexing happens. Share your Mini App URL to the social feed, and indexing starts automaticallyâ€”no review process required.

## How indexing works

Understanding the indexing process helps you diagnose why your Mini App may not be appearing.

<Note>
Your manifest must be properly configured and validated for indexing to work. See [manifest documentation](/mini-apps/core-concepts/manifest) for required fields and validation.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Share your Mini App URL">
  Share your URL to the feed.
</Step>
<Step title="The Base app validates your manifest">
  The Base app fetches and validates your manifest file.
  <Warning>
  Invalid or unreachable manifests will fail indexing.
  </Warning>
</Step>
<Step title="Your app enters the directory">
  Your Mini App is recorded and becomes searchable within 10 minutes.

</Steps>


## How search works
The Base App's search queries your Mini App's `name` field from the catalog. Both exact and partial matches appear in results. Search displays your Mini App based on information you provided in your manifest.

<Note>
When making changes to your manifest, you will need to share your URL to reindex.

## Discovery surfaces

### Category browsing
Your app appears in the category specified by `primaryCategory` in your manifest. Users browse categories to discover apps by interest.

</Frame>

<Note>
**Category rankings**: Rankings use 7-day engagement metrics such as shares. 
</Note>

### Saved apps
When users save your Mini App, it appears in their personal saved options for quick access. Prompt users to save at key moments.

</Frame>

### Direct messages

When users share your Mini App URL in a direct message, it displays as an interactive embed. Recipients can preview and open your app directly from the conversation, with `context.location` set to `messaging` so you can customize the experience for shared discovery.
