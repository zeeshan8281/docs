## Authentication

Authenticate when it unlocks value, not before. Fast, optional sign‑in keeps momentum and lets users act the moment onchain interactions are needed.

## Manifest

Your manifest powers saving, discovery, and rich embeds. A strong manifest includes complete fields, valid assets, and `noindex: true` during testing.

## Embeds & Previews

Distribution starts in the feed: compelling previews with a clear image and launch button turn impressions into launches.

## Search & Discovery

Be found across surfaces: set a primary category, share once to trigger indexing, and keep assets valid to appear in search and categories.

## Sharing & Social Graph

Design for social lift: native share flows and social navigation turn single‑player moments into threads and returns.

## Notifications (coming soon)

Re‑engage saved users with relevant, rate‑limited notifications at the right moments.

Build for compact, touch‑first contexts: respect safe areas, keep interfaces concise, and emphasize clear primary actions.
