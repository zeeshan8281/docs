title: Converting Any Web App to a Mini App
description: Learn how to transform any existing web application into a Mini App for Base App and Farcaster clients. This framework-agnostic guide covers the four essential components needed for integration.

> **What you'll learn**  
> By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:
> - Set up the required manifest file to register your app with Mini App clients
> - Implement embed metadata for rich social sharing and discovery
> - Integrate context APIs to access user data and onchain functionality
> - Configure ready state handling for optimal loading experience


<Tip>
**Using React?** If you're building a React application and want to use MiniKit with additional onchain components, follow the [MiniKit integration guide for existing apps](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/quickstart/existing-apps/install) instead of this guide.

## Core Concept: What Makes an App a Mini App

Mini Apps provide many benefits, including access to a users social graph, native distribution channels (e.g Base app or any Farcaster client) and ability to be launched without approval . [Learn more about why mini apps](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/overview).

### Key Differences from Regular Web Apps

**Hosted Environment**: Your app runs in a view similar to an iframe or WebView.

**Social Context**: Access to user's profile, social connections, and onchain wallet

**Discovery**: Found through social feeds and app stores, not search engines

**Launch Flow**: Users tap a button in their social feed to instantly open your app

### The Four Essential Components

Your existing web app needs these additions to function as a Mini App:

**Manifest** - Registers your app identity with client hosts

**Embed Metadata** - Creates rich previews when shared in social feeds

**SDK Integration** - Accesses user context and social functionality

**Ready State** - Signals when your app has finished loading

These components work together: the manifest tells clients about your app, embeds help users discover it, the SDK provides social functionality, and ready state ensures smooth loading.
