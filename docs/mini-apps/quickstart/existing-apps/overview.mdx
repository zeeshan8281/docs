title: Converting Any Web App to a Mini App
description: Learn how to transform any existing web application into a Mini App for Base App and Farcaster clients. This framework-agnostic guide covers the four essential components needed for integration.

> **What you'll learn**  
> By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:
> - Set up the required manifest file to register your app with Mini App clients
> - Implement embed metadata for rich social sharing and discovery
> - Integrate context APIs to access user data and onchain functionality
> - Configure ready state handling for optimal loading experience


<Tip>
**Using React?** If you're building a React application and want to use MiniKit with additional onchain components, follow the [MiniKit integration guide for existing apps](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/quickstart/existing-apps/install) instead of this guide.

## Core Concept: What Makes an App a Mini App

Mini Apps provide many benefits, including access to a users social graph, native distribution channels (e.g Base app or any Farcaster client) and ability to be launched without approval . [Learn more about why mini apps](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/overview).

### Key Differences from Regular Web Apps

**Hosted Environment**: Your app runs in a view similar to an iframe or WebView.

**Social Context**: Access to user's profile, social connections, and onchain wallet

**Discovery**: Found through social feeds and app stores, not search engines

**Launch Flow**: Users tap a button in their social feed to instantly open your app

### The Four Essential Components

Your existing web app needs these additions to function as a Mini App:

**Manifest** - Registers your app identity with client hosts

**Embed Metadata** - Creates rich previews when shared in social feeds

**SDK Integration** - Accesses user context and social functionality

**Ready State** - Signals when your app has finished loading

These components work together: the manifest tells clients about your app, embeds help users discover it, the SDK provides social functionality, and ready state ensures smooth loading.

## Set Up Your Application Manifest

The application manifest serves as your Mini App's identity card. Host clients use this file to identify your app, display its metadata, and verify domain ownership.
