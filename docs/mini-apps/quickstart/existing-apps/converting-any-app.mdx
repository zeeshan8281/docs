</Tip>

## Core Concept: What Makes an App a Mini App

Mini Apps are web applications that run inside Farcaster and Base clients instead of traditional browsers. This changes how your app is discovered, launched, and interacts with users.

### Key Differences from Regular Web Apps

**Hosted Environment**: Your app runs in an iframe or WebView within client apps like Warpcast

**Social Context**: Access to user's Farcaster profile, social connections, and onchain wallet

**Discovery**: Found through social feeds and app stores, not search engines

**Launch Flow**: Users tap a button in their social feed to instantly open your app

### The Four Essential Components

Your existing web app needs these additions to function as a Mini App:

**Manifest** - Registers your app identity with client hosts

**Embed Metadata** - Creates rich previews when shared in social feeds

**SDK Integration** - Accesses user context and social functionality

**Ready State** - Signals when your app has finished loading

These components work together: the manifest tells clients about your app, embeds help users discover it, the SDK provides social functionality, and ready state ensures smooth loading.

## Set Up Your Application Manifest

The application manifest serves as your Mini App's identity card. Host clients use this file to identify your app, display its metadata, and verify domain ownership.

### Why You Need a Manifest

The manifest performs two critical functions:
- **App Identity**: Tells clients your app's name, icon, and display properties
- **Domain Verification**: The `accountAssociation` proves you control both the domain and linked Farcaster account, enabling features like notifications


### Manifest Requirements

Your manifest file must meet these requirements:

<Warning>
- Must be accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json`
- Must return valid JSON with `Content-Type: application/json`  
- Must be publicly accessible (no authentication required)
- Must include both `accountAssociation` and `frame`/`miniapp` objects
</Warning>

### Complete Manifest Structure

```json
{
  "accountAssociation": {
    "header": "eyJmaWQiOjkxNTIsInR5cGUiOiJjdXN0b2R5Iiwia2V5IjoiMHgwMmVmNzkwRGQ3OTkzQTM1ZkQ4NDdDMDUzRURkQUU5NDBEMDU1NTk2In0",
    "payload": "eyJkb21haW4iOiJhcHAuZXhhbXBsZS5jb20ifQ",
    "signature": "MHgxMGQwZGU4ZGYwZDUwZTdmMGIxN2YxMTU2NDI1MjRmZTY0MTUyZGU4ZGU1MWU0MThiYjU4ZjVmZmQxYjRjNDBiNGVlZTRhNDcwNmVmNjhlMzQ0ZGQ5MDBkYmQyMmNlMmVlZGY5ZGQ0N2JlNWRmNzMwYzUxNjE4OWVjZDJjY2Y0MDFj"
  },
  "baseBuilder": {
    "allowedAddresses": ["0x..."]
  },
  "frame": {
    "version": "1",
    "name": "Example Mini App",
    "homeUrl": "https://ex.co",
    "iconUrl": "https://ex.co/i.png",
    "splashImageUrl": "https://ex.co/l.png",
    "splashBackgroundColor": "#000000",
    "webhookUrl": "https://ex.co/api/webhook",
    "subtitle": "Fast, fun, social",
    "description": "A fast, fun way to challenge friends in real time.",
    "screenshotUrls": [
      "https://ex.co/s1.png",
      "https://ex.co/s2.png",
      "https://ex.co/s3.png"
    ],
    "primaryCategory": "social",
    "tags": ["example", "miniapp", "baseapp"],
    "heroImageUrl": "https://ex.co/og.png",
    "tagline": "Play instantly",
    "ogTitle": "Example Mini App",
    "ogDescription": "Challenge friends in real time.",
    "ogImageUrl": "https://ex.co/og.png",
    "noindex": true
  }
}
```

### Framework-Specific Implementation

Choose the approach that matches your technology stack:

- **Next.js:** Create API route at `app/.well-known/farcaster.json/route.ts`
- **Vite/Static sites:** Place file in `public/.well-known/farcaster.json`
- **Express/Node.js:** Add route handler for `/.well-known/farcaster.json`
- **Any framework:** Ensure the URL resolves and returns the JSON

### Generate Your Account Association

1. Visit the [Mini App Manifest Tool](https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/new)
2. Enter your domain exactly as you'll host the manifest
3. Generate your `accountAssociation` object
4. Copy the generated values into your manifest

### Verify Your Setup

Test your manifest accessibility by visiting `https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/farcaster.json` in your browser. You should see your JSON manifest returned with the correct content type.

## Add Embed Metadata for Social Sharing

Embed metadata transforms your Mini App URLs into rich, interactive previews when shared in social feeds. Instead of plain text links, users will see preview images and launch buttons.

### Why Embed Metadata Matters

When users share your app's URL:
- **Rich Previews**: Displays your app's image and description
- **Direct Launch**: Provides a button to open your Mini App immediately


### Implementation by Framework

**Next.js**
```typescript
// app/layout.tsx or page.tsx
export const metadata = {
  other: {
    'fc:frame': JSON.stringify({
      version: "next",
      imageUrl: "https://yourapp.com/preview.png",
      button: {
        title: "Launch App",
        action: {
          type: "launch_frame",
          url: "https://yourapp.com"
        }
      }
    })
  }
}
```

**HTML-based Applications**
```html
<!-- Add to <head> section -->
<meta name="fc:frame" content='{"version":"next","imageUrl":"https://yourapp.com/preview.png","button":{"title":"Launch App","action":{"type":"launch_frame","url":"https://yourapp.com"}}}' />
```

<Note>
Both `fc:frame` and `fc:miniapp` meta tags are accepted by clients.
</Note>

## Integrate Context and User Data

The [Mini App SDK](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/getting-started) provides access to user's social context and enables app-specific functionality like notifications and cast composition.

### Why Context Integration Is Essential

Context integration allows your app to:
- **Access User Data**: Get the user's Farcaster profile, FID, and connected wallet
- **Send Notifications**: Notify users about important events or updates
- **Create Social Actions**: Enable users to compose casts directly from your app


### Choose Your Integration Path

**For React Applications**
Follow the [MiniKit integration guide](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/quickstart/existing-apps/install) for React-specific hooks and onchain components.

**For All Other Frameworks**
Follow the [Farcaster Mini Apps Getting Started Guide](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/getting-started) to integrate the core SDK.

<Tip>
MiniKit is built on top of the Mini App SDK and provides additional React hooks and onchain components for easier integration in React applications.
</Tip>

## Configure Ready State Handling

Mini Apps display a splash screen while loading. You must call the `ready()` function to signal when your app has finished loading.

### Why Ready State Matters

- **User Experience**: Replaces the loading splash screen with your app interface
- **Performance Perception**: Shows users when your app is fully functional
- **Required Behavior**: Host clients expect this signal to know when to hide loading states

### Implementation Examples

Choose the guide that matches your setup:

- **Mini App SDK**: [Ready Action Documentation](https://miniapps.farcaster.xyz/docs/sdk/actions/ready)
- **MiniKit**: [Frame Readiness Documentation](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/technical-reference/minikit/hooks/useMiniKit#frame-readiness)

## Understanding Notification Requirements

Notifications enhance user engagement but require server-side infrastructure. If your app is frontend-only, you have several options to add notification capabilities.

### Why Notifications Need a Backend

Notifications require server-side handling because:
- **Security**: Notification tokens must be stored securely in a database
- **Webhooks**: Tokens are delivered to your server when users add your Mini App
- **CORS Restrictions**: Notifications must be sent from your server, not the client

<Warning>
Frontend-only applications cannot implement notifications without additional server infrastructure.
</Warning>

### Options for Frontend-Only Projects

Choose the approach that best fits your setup:

1. **Add Server Routes**: Extend your app with Express.js/Node.js API endpoints
2. **Use Serverless Functions**: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify with API function support
3. **Managed Services**: Use [Neynar](https://docs.neynar.com/docs/send-notifications-to-mini-app-users) for managed notification infrastructure
4. **Skip Notifications**: Build your Mini App without notification features

### Webhook Configuration

If implementing notifications, add the webhook URL to your manifest:

```json
{
  "frame": {
    "webhookUrl": "https://yourapp.com/api/webhook"
  }
}
```
