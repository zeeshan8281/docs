## What is a Mini App?

A mini app is a lightweight web app that runs directly inside Farcaster clients like Base App, without needing to open a browser or download anything. Built using familiar tools like Next.js and MiniKit, mini apps behave just like normal apps — but launch instantly from posts, making them feel native to the social experience.

This guide gets you from zero to a running Mini App using the MiniKit template.
