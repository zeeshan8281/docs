## What is a Mini App?

A mini app is a lightweight web app that runs directly inside Farcaster clients like Base App, without needing to open a browser or download anything. Built using familiar tools like Next.js and MiniKit, mini apps behave just like normal apps — but launch instantly from posts, making them feel native to the social experience.

This guide gets you from zero to a running Mini App using the MiniKit template.

## Prerequisites

1. Farcaster account (for testing and manifest signing)
2. Optional: Coinbase Developer Platform account for a Client API key

## Create your project

<Steps>
<Step title="Use the CLI to scaffold a Mini App">

```bash Terminal
npx create-onchain --mini
```

You’ll be prompted for a CDP Client API key. You can generate one in the Coinbase Developer Platform.

<Tip>
These docs are LLM‑friendly—reference llms.txt in your editor to streamline builds and prompts:

</Step>

<Step title="Skip manifest setup for now">
You’ll configure the manifest after you have a stable URL in the Deploy step.
</Step>

<Step title="Install dependencies and run locally">

```bash Terminal
cd your-project-name
npm install
npm run dev
```

</Step>
</Steps>

Next: Deploy your app to a live URL used when creating your manifest.
