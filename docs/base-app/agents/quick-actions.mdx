## Quick Actions

While Base App supports all standard XMTP content types for rich messaging capabilities, this document focuses specifically on **Base-developed content types** that enhance agent interactions within Base App.

These Base-specific content types (Quick Actions and Intent) provide unique functionality that may not be supported by other XMTP clients. For standard XMTP content types like reactions, attachments, and transactions, see the [XMTP documentation](https://docs.xmtp.org/agents/content-types/content-types).

## Base App Content Types

There are content types developed by the Base App team for agents in Base App. Other XMTP clients may not support these content types.

**Quick Actions (coinbase.com/actions:1.0)**

Purpose: Present interactive buttons in a message

Structure:

```typescript
type ActionsContent = {
  id: string;
  description: string;
  actions: Action[];
  expiresAt?: string;
};

type Action = {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  style?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  expiresAt?: string;
};
```

Validation Rules:

- `id`, `description` are required
- `actions` must be 1â€“10 items with unique IDs
- Style must be one of: `primary`, `secondary`, `danger`

Fallback:

```
[Description]

[1] [Action Label 1]
[2] [Action Label 2]
...
Reply with the number to select
```

Example: Payment Options

```json
{
  "id": "payment_alice_123",
  "description": "Choose amount to send to Alice",
  "actions": [
    { "id": "send_10", "label": "Send $10", "style": "primary" },
    { "id": "send_20", "label": "Send $20", "style": "primary" },
    { "id": "custom_amount", "label": "Custom Amount", "style": "secondary" }
  ],
  "expiresAt": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

**Intent (coinbase.com/intent:1.0)**

Purpose: User expresses choice from Quick Actions

Structure:

```typescript
type IntentContent = {
  id: string;
  actionId: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, string | number | boolean | null>;
};
```

Validation Rules:

- `id`, `actionId` required
- Must match corresponding Actions
- `metadata` is optional, `<10KB`

Fallback:

```
User selected action: [actionId]
```

Example: Intent Message

```json
{
  id: 'payment_alice_123',
  actionId: 'send_10',
  metadata: {
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    actionLabel: 'Send $10'
  }
}
```
