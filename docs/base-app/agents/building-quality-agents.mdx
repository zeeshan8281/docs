As you start building, review these guidelines to understand what makes an agent successful in the Base app. We recommend trying out existing agents in the app first to get a feel for the quality bar, what works well, and areas for improvement.

## Build a high quality foundation

Your agent should provide a seamless, professional experience that users will want to engage with repeatedly. Here are the core requirements:

### Responding to messages

**Multi-Channel Support**
- Respond to both DMs and group chats appropriately
- Maintain consistent functionality across different conversation types

**Immediate Feedback**
- React to messages with a simple reaction (👀, 👍, ⌛, etc.) to show acknowledgment
- This gives users confidence their message was received while processing

**Fast Response Times**
- Provide responses quickly (< 5 seconds)
- Users expect near-instant communication in messaging apps

### Group Chat Etiquette

In group chats, agents should only respond when:

1. **Mentioned directly** with "@" + agent name (e.g., @bankr)
2. **Replied to directly** when a user replies to the agent's message using the reply content type

This prevents spam and ensures agents participate naturally in group conversations.

### Communication Style

**Sound Human**
- Use conversational, fun, and clear language
- Keep responses polished but not robotic
- Match the energy and tone of the conversation

**Privacy Conscious**
- Only ask for personal information when absolutely necessary
- Always explain why the information is needed
- Respect user privacy and data minimization principles

## Craft compelling onboarding

Your agent's first impression is critical. The onboarding message should immediately communicate value and give users a clear path forward.

### Great Onboarding Message Structure

1. **Introduce the agent** - Quick, friendly greeting with the agent's name
2. **Explain capabilities** - Clear, specific examples of what it can do
4. **Use quick select buttons** - Make it easy for users to select an action to take with the agent

### Example: High-Quality Onboarding

```
hey, i'm bankr. i can help you trade, transfer, and manage your crypto. here's the rundown:

• trade anything: buy, sell, swap tokens on base, polygon, and mainnet. try "buy 0.1 eth of degen."
• send it: transfer crypto to anyone on x, farcaster, or a wallet address.
• get alpha: token recs, market data, charts.
• automate: set up recurring buys/sells. e.g. "buy $10 of $bnkr every week."

what do you want to do first?
```

**Why this works:**
- Friendly, conversational tone
- Specific feature examples with concrete commands
- Clear value propositions
- Ends with a direct call-to-action

### Example: Poor Onboarding

```
Gm! What can I help you with?
```

**Why this fails:**
- Generic greeting with no context
- No explanation of capabilities
- Puts burden on user to figure out what to do
- No clear value proposition

## Showcase unique value

### Solve Real Problems

Your agent should:
- **Address a unique pain point** or bring a delightful twist to an existing space
- **Help users accomplish tasks** more easily than existing solutions
- **Provide clear benefits** that users can understand immediately

### Enable User Success

Focus on helping users:
- **Earn** - Generate income, rewards, or value
- **Connect** - Build relationships or communities
- **Have fun** - Provide entertainment or engaging experiences
- **Complete tasks** - Streamline workflows or processes

### Design for Engagement

**Build Natural Growth Loops**
- Include features that encourage sharing, re-engagement, and habit forming
- Make it beneficial for users to invite others
- Create ongoing value that brings users back

**Plan the User Journey**
1. **Define the ideal user experience first**
2. **Craft agent messages around that journey**
3. **Guide users through progressive value discovery**

### Continuous Engagement Strategy

As users complete actions with your agent:

- **Show clear next steps** - Always give users something else to try
- **Highlight ongoing value** - Explain how continued use benefits them
- **Create habit loops** - Design features that encourage regular interaction
- **Prevent one-and-done usage** - Build features that require return visits

### Examples of Engagement Features

- **Progressive features** - Unlock new capabilities as users engage more
- **Personalization** - Learn user preferences and customize experiences  
- **Social elements** - Enable sharing achievements or inviting friends
- **Recurring value** - Automated tasks, alerts, or regular check-ins
- **Gamification** - Points, levels, or achievement systems
