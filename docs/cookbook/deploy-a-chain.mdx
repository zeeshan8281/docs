## What Are Base Appchains?

Base Appchains are **app-specific Layer 3 rollups** built on Base that provide dedicated blockspace for individual applications. Instead of competing with thousands of other apps for network resources, you get your own high-performance blockchain that rolls up to Base and inherits Ethereum's security.

<Note>
Layer 3 appchains roll up to Base (Layer 2), which settles on Ethereum, providing you with dedicated performance while maintaining the security guarantees of the Ethereum ecosystem.
</Note>

Think of it as the difference between **sharing a highway during rush hour** versus **having your own dedicated express lane**. With shared blockspace, your app's performance depends on network-wide activity. With an Appchain, you get consistent, predictable performance regardless of what's happening elsewhere.

<Card title="Shared Blockspace" icon="users">
Compete with other apps for network resources, leading to variable performance, unpredictable costs, and user experience issues during peak times.
</Card>

<Card title="Dedicated Blockspace" icon="server">
Your own infrastructure with predictable performance, custom gas tokens, full control over throughput, and consistent user experience.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Choose Base Appchains?

## Technical Architecture

Base Appchains are built on the **OP Enclave framework**, providing fast withdrawals and seamless integration with Base Mainnet. This architecture enables near-instant bridging while maintaining security through innovative proving mechanisms.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="OP Enclave Framework">
Built on Optimism's latest technology for **near-instant bridging** between your Appchain and Base Mainnet. Users can move funds in seconds rather than the typical 7-day withdrawal periods of traditional rollups.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alternative Data Availability">
Uses **Amazon S3** for cost-efficient data storage while maintaining security through **AWS Nitro Enclave** verification. This approach significantly reduces costs while ensuring data integrity and availability.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Permissions & Gas Tokens">
Control which contracts can be called on your chain, effectively managing blockspace allocation. Implement **custom gas tokens** and **permission systems** while protecting users from censorship through guaranteed deposit lanes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Immediate State Proving">
Unlike traditional rollups that rely on challenge periods, Base Appchains use **immediate state proving** through secure enclaves, enabling instant finality and faster user experiences.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Use Cases & Success Stories

Base Appchains power applications across gaming, DeFi, and enterprise sectors that require high performance and predictable costs.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Gaming">
Process millions of micro-transactions for in-game actions, NFT trades, and player interactions without network congestion affecting gameplay performance.

**Success Story**: Super Champs chose Base Appchains for consistent throughput, comparing the experience to "gaming on iOS" - smooth, predictable, and reliable.
</Tab>

<Tab title="DeFi">
Handle high-frequency trading, yield farming, and complex financial operations with consistent, low-cost transactions that don't fluctuate with network activity.

**Success Story**: Applications processing high-volume trading data benefit from predictable costs and dedicated throughput for time-sensitive operations.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Enterprise">
Deploy compliance-ready solutions with dedicated infrastructure, custom permissions, and the ability to manage access controls while maintaining transparency.

**Success Story**: Proof 8 uses blockchain technology for verifiable inventory ownership in warehouses and distilleries, where enterprise customers prioritize performance, security, and privacy.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Base Appchains are designed for **mature projects** with significant transaction volumes. If you're just starting out or have low transaction volumes, consider building on Base Mainnet first to establish product-market fit.
</Warning>

## When Should You Consider an Appchain?

Base Appchains are ideal for applications that have outgrown shared blockspace limitations. Use this checklist to determine if an Appchain is right for your project:

<Check>
**High Transaction Volume**: Your app generates thousands of transactions daily and performance is affected by network congestion
</Check>

<Check>
**Significant Gas Sponsorship**: You're spending substantial amounts sponsoring gas costs for users through Paymaster or similar solutions
</Check>

<Check>
**Performance-Critical Operations**: User experience is negatively impacted by variable transaction times or network congestion
</Check>

<Check>
**Custom Requirements**: You need custom gas tokens, specialized permissions, or governance mechanisms not available on shared chains
</Check>

<Check>
**Predictable Costs**: Fixed operational costs are important for your business model and budgeting
</Check>

<Info>
If you're considering launching your own L1 or L2 blockchain, Base Appchains offer a compelling alternative with faster time-to-market, proven infrastructure, and immediate access to Base's ecosystem.
