Before sharing your Mini App, validate everything works.

## Pre‑deployment checklist

- App is deployed at a public HTTPS domain
- Environment variables are set on your deployment platform
- `/.well-known/farcaster.json` returns valid JSON
- `fc:frame` metadata renders a launch button when shared

## Validation Tools

[Base Build](https://base.dev) is the place to test and validate your Mini App. In addition to tracking your app’s usage and redeeming builder rewards, it includes a **Preview tool**, which helps you:  

- Validate your app's manifest and metadata  
- Test how your app will appear in the Base app  
- Verify ownership and account association  

The Preview tool provides clear visual cues:  
- ✅ Green check marks when things are set up correctly  
- ❌ Red indicators when something needs your attention  

### Components of the Preview Tool  

The Preview tool has three main components:  

- **Console**: Preview your app and review logs to make informed decisions about performance.  
- **Account Association**: Confirm your app is linked to the correct account, signatures are valid, and the domain matches what’s specified in the manifest.  
- **Metadata**: Ensure your Mini App renders exactly as expected by verifying required fields like name, icon, tags, and splash image.  

### Getting Started  

1. [Import your app](https://docs.base.org/mini-apps/technical-guides/data-driven-growth) into Base Build
2. Visit the [Preview tool](https://base.dev/preview) to begin validating your app



## Share and test

1. Create a cast with your app’s URL
