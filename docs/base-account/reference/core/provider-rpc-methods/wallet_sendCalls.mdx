</Info>

## Parameters

<ParamField body="version" type="string" required>
The version of the API format. This must be "2.0.0".
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="id" type="string">
The ID of the batch of calls for tracking purposes.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="from" type="string" required>
The sender's address.
Pattern: `^0x[0-9a-fA-F]{40}$`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="chainId" type="string" required>
The EIP-155 chain ID of the calls. This must match the currently selected network in the wallet.
Pattern: `^0x([1-9a-f]+[0-9a-f]*|0)$`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="atomicRequired" type="boolean" required>
`true` if the wallet must execute all calls atomically. If `false`, the wallet may execute the calls sequentially without atomicity. If `false` and the wallet is capable of executing the calls atomically, it may do so.

| 5720   | There is already a batch submitted with the specified batch ID           | Duplicate batch ID |

<Warning>
Ensure that the `chainId` matches the currently selected network in the wallet to avoid transaction failures.
</Warning>

<Tip>
When `atomicRequired` is set to `false`, consider the implications of partial execution if some calls fail while others succeed.
