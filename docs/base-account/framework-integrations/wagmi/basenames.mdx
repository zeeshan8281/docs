## Overview

Basenames are human-readable names for addresses on Base.
They are built on top of the ENS protocol and comply with [ENSIP-19](https://docs.ens.domains/ensip/19/).
To learn more about Basenames, check out the [Basenames FAQ](/base-account/basenames/basenames-faq).

This guide will show you how to add support for Basenames to your application using [Viem](https://viem.sh/).

## Usage

Use `getEnsName` to retrieve the primary ENS name for an address on Base:

```ts getBasename.ts
import { createPublicClient, http, toCoinType } from 'viem'
import { base } from 'viem/chains'

const client = createPublicClient({
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(YOUR_PRIVATE_RPC_URL),
})

const name = await client.getEnsName({
  address: '0x179A862703a4adfb29896552DF9e307980D19285',
  coinType: toCoinType(base.id),
})
```

<Tip>

It is necessary to use a private RPC provider (`YOUR_PRIVATE_RPC_URL`) due to the computational demands associated with some of the ENSIP-19 resolution steps.

</Tip>

<Warning>

There may be some latency between the initial registration of a Basename and the ability to resolve this name via ENSIP-19 due to the slow production of state proofs necessary for trustless resolution.
</Warning>
