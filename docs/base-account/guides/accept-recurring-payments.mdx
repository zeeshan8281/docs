## How It Works

Base Subscriptions leverage **spend permissions** – a powerful onchain primitive that allows users to grant revocable spending rights to applications. Here's the complete flow:

<Steps>
<Step title="User Approves Subscription">
Your customer grants your application permission to charge their wallet up to a specified amount each billing period. This is a one-time approval that remains active until cancelled.
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Periodic Charging">
Your backend service charges the subscription when payment is due, without requiring any user interaction. You can charge up to the approved amount per period.
</Step>

<Step title="Smart Period Management">
The spending limit automatically resets at the start of each new period. If you don't charge the full amount in one period, it doesn't roll over.
</Step>

<Step title="User Maintains Control">
Customers can view and cancel their subscriptions anytime through their wallet, ensuring transparency and trust.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation Requirements

<Warning>
**Security Requirements**

To accept recurring payments, you need:
1. A dedicated wallet address to act as the subscription owner (spender)
2. Backend infrastructure to execute charges securely
3. Database to store and manage subscription IDs
4. Never expose private keys in client-side code
</Warning>

### Technical Architecture

A complete subscription implementation requires both client and server components:

**Client-Side (Frontend):**
- User interface for subscription creation
- Create wallet requests and handle user responses

**Server-Side (Backend):**
- Wallet for executing charges
- Scheduled jobs for periodic billing
- Database for subscription tracking
- Handlers for status updates
- Retry logic for failed charges

## Real-World Use Cases

### SaaS Subscription Example

A project management tool charging $29.99/month:

<Steps>
<Step title="Customer Signs Up">
User selects plan and approves the subscription through your app's interface.
</Step>

<Step title="Instant Access">
Grant immediate access to premium features upon subscription confirmation.
</Step>

<Step title="Automatic Billing">
Your backend charges the subscription on the same day each month.
</Step>

<Step title="Continuous Service">
As long as charges succeed, the user maintains uninterrupted access.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Usage-Based API Service

An AI API service with pay-as-you-go pricing capped at $100/month:

<Steps>
<Step title="Set Usage Cap">
User approves a $100 monthly spending limit for your service.
</Step>

<Step title="Track Usage">
Your system tracks API calls and calculates costs in real-time.
</Step>

<Step title="Charge Actual Usage">
At month's end, charge only what was used (e.g., $47.23 of the $100 limit).
</Step>

<Step title="Reset Next Period">
The $100 limit automatically resets for the next month.
</Step>
</Steps>
