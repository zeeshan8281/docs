## Overview

Spend Permissions let you designate a trusted `spender` that can move assets out of a user's Base Account on their behalf.

After the user signs the permission, the `spender` can initiate transfers within the limits you define — no additional prompts, pop-ups, or signatures needed from the user. This powers seamless experiences such as subscription renewals, algorithmic trading, and automated payouts.

Read more about the Spend Permission Manager contract and supported chains on [GitHub](https://github.com/coinbase/spend-permissions).


## Usage

### Request a Spend Permission

You create an EIP-712 payload that describes the permission and ask the user to sign it. Store the resulting signature along with the permission data so you can register the permission on-chain later.

| Field Name | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| `account` | `address` | Smart account this spend permission is valid for |
| `spender` | `address` | Entity that can spend `account`'s tokens |
| `token` | `address` | Token address (ERC-7528 native token or ERC-20 contract) |
| `allowance` | `uint160` | Maximum allowed value to spend within each `period` |
| `period` | `uint48` | Time duration for resetting used `allowance` on a recurring basis (seconds) |
| `start` | `uint48` | Timestamp this spend permission is valid starting at (inclusive, unix seconds) |
| `end` | `uint48` | Timestamp this spend permission is valid until (exclusive, unix seconds) |
| `salt` | `uint256` | Arbitrary data to differentiate unique spend permissions with otherwise identical fields |
| `extraData` | `bytes` | Arbitrary data to attach to a spend permission which may be consumed by the `spender` |

```tsx
const SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ADDRESS = '0xf85210B21cC50302F477BA56686d2019dC9b67Ad' as const;

const spendPermissionData = {
  account: '0x...',
  spender: '0x...',
  token: '0x...',
  allowance: '0x...',
  period: '0x...',
  start: new Date().getTime() / 1000,
  end: new Date().getTime() / 1000 + 60 * 60 * 24 * 30, // 30 days
  salt: '0x',
  extraData: '0x',
}

const eip712Data = {
  domain: {
    name: 'Spend Permission Manager',
    version: '1',
    chainId: 8453, // or any other supported chain
    verifyingContract: SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ADDRESS,
  },
  types: {
    SpendPermission: [
      { name: 'account', type: 'address' },
      { name: 'spender', type: 'address' },
      { name: 'token', type: 'address' },
      { name: 'allowance', type: 'uint160' },
      { name: 'period', type: 'uint48' },
      { name: 'start', type: 'uint48' },
      { name: 'end', type: 'uint48' },
      { name: 'salt', type: 'uint256' },
      { name: 'extraData', type: 'bytes' },
    ],
  },
  primaryType: 'SpendPermission',
  message: spendPermissionData,
};

// Request a signature from the user
const signature = await provider.request({
  method: 'eth_signTypedData_v4',
  params: [account, JSON.stringify(eip712Data)],
});

console.log('Spend Permission signature:', signature);
```

### Use the Spend Permission

Using a permission is a two-step flow:

1. **Register the permission** — Call `approveWithSignature` with the signed payload to store the permission on-chain.
2. **Spend tokens** — From the `spender` address, call `spend` with the same payload and an `amount`. The contract validates the permission and transfers tokens from the user's account to the `spender`.

You can batch the two calls into a single transaction (see the example below), or send them separately. Registration only needs to happen once per permission.

The easiest way to encode these function calls is to use a tool such as [viem](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/encodeFunctionData#encodefunctiondata). 

Find the ABI for the Spend Permission Manager contract [here](https://github.com/ilikesymmetry/spend-permissions-quickstart/blob/main/lib/abi/SpendPermissionManager.ts) or on [Basescan](https://basescan.org/address/0xf85210B21cC50302F477BA56686d2019dC9b67Ad#code).


```tsx
const SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ADDRESS = '0xf85210B21cC50302F477BA56686d2019dC9b67Ad' as const;
const spendPermissionManagerAbi = [...]; // See the ABI file above

// Approval call
const approvalCallData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: spendPermissionManagerAbi,
  functionName: 'approveWithSignature',
  args: [spendPermissionData, signature],
});

// Spend call
const spendCallData = encodeFunctionData({
  abi: spendPermissionManagerAbi,
  functionName: 'spend',
  args: [spendPermissionData, amount],
});

// Send the calls from the spender wallet using an EIP-1193 wallet provider
// const provider = ...

// This combines the approval and spend calls into a single transaction
// but you can also send them separately and the approval only needs to be done once
const callsId = await provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_sendCalls',
  params: [
    {
      version: "2.0",
      atomicRequired: true,
      from: spender,
      calls: [
        { to: SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ADDRESS, data: approvalCallData, value: '0x0' },
        { to: SPEND_PERMISSION_MANAGER_ADDRESS, data: spendCallData, value: '0x0' },
      ],
    }
  ],
})
```
