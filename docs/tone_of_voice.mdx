<voice_and_tone>

## Voice
Professional and direct - No preamble. State facts clearly.
Active voice - Identify who does what.
❌ The data is processed by the function
 ✅ The function processes data
Conversational brevity - Use "you" but cut excess words.
❌ You should configure the environment variables
 ✅ Configure your environment variables
Data over description - Show metrics, not marketing.
❌ incredibly fast → ✅ completes in < 100ms

<writing_standards>

## Structure

**Strong verbs** - Choose precise action verbs over weak ones (is, are, occurs, happens).

**Concise sentences** - One idea per sentence. Target 15-20 words, maximum 30.

**Direct constructions** - Start with the subject. Eliminate "There is/There are" and filler phrases (~~at this point in time~~ → now, ~~is able to~~ → can).

**Progressive disclosure** - Essential info first, then standard workflows, then error cases, finally advanced topics.

## Terminology

**Consistent** - One term per concept throughout all documentation (parameter OR argument, method OR function).

**Precise** - Use explicit names: ❌ "the auth file" → ✅ "`authentication.js`"

**Clear** - Define abbreviations on first use: "Application Programming Interface (API)" → then use "API"

## Organization

**Focused paragraphs** - One topic per paragraph with a clear topic sentence.

**Strategic lists** - Numbered for sequential steps, bulleted for unordered items. Maintain parallel structure.

**Clear instructions** - Start steps with imperative verbs (Install, Configure, Initialize).

## Code

Write complete, runnable examples with error handling, expected outputs, and realistic values (use environment variables, not placeholders).

```javascript
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;

try {
  const result = calculateTotal([10, 20, 30]);
  console.log(result); // Output: 60
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Calculation failed: ${error.message}`);
}
```

</writing_standards>

<prohibited>
Never use: emojis, placeholder values (YOUR_API_KEY), weak verbs (is, are, occurs), "There is/There are", marketing language, mixed terminology, vague link text ("click here"), unexplained concepts, passive voice without justification.
</prohibited>

<mintlify>
Page structure requires YAML frontmatter with title and description. Use `<Steps>` for procedures, `<Tabs>` for platform variations, `<CodeGroup>` for multi-language examples, callouts for context (`<Note>`, `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`), `<Frame>` for images, and field components for API docs.
</mintlify>

<verification>
Before output: sentences under 30 words with strong verbs and active voice, terms defined and consistent, no emojis, code examples complete with error handling, proper frontmatter and components used.

<example>
**Before:** "There is a configuration file that is used for setting up the API client. The file should be located in the root directory and it needs to have the API key and endpoint URL."

**After:** "The `config.json` file configures your API client. Place it in your project's root directory. Required fields: `apiKey` and `endpointUrl`. Missing files trigger initialization errors."
</example>
