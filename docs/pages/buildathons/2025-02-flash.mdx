# Buildathon: 2025-02-flash

## Flashblocks Builder Side Quest

With Flashblocks, a technology built by Flashbots, Base chain will have 200-millisecond block times. This will make Base 10x faster than it is today, and the fastest EVM chain to date.

To celebrate this, we're running a one day Builder Side Quest with a 2 ETH prize pool!

## Prompt

Build a mobile-friendly web app that showcases the 10x speed improvement of Flashblocks on Base Sepolia:

1. Should be able to view 2s full blocks
2. Should be able to view 200ms flashblocks
3. (Bonus) Should be able to submit a tx and see how much faster it lands in a flashblock than a full block

Submissions are due by 2pm MNT (GMT-7) on Friday 2/28 and will be judged on clarity and creativity, by members of the [@buildonbase](https://x.com/buildonbase) chain team, Base DevRel team, and [Flashbots](https://github.com/flashbots) team.

Winners will be announced **Fri 2/28 3pm MT at the Home Base booth and on socials** — join us for free pizza and flashblocks demo

## Start Building

Visit our [Flashblocks page](https://www.base.org/flashblocks) for comprehensive documentation on how to build with Flashblocks, including detailed examples and response formats.

Flashblocks is enabled for developers on Base Sepolia, providing ultra-fast 200-millisecond block times. You can integrate with Flashblocks in two ways:

:::steps

### Flashblock WebSocket endpoint

Stream real-time block updates over a WebSocket connection at:

```
wss://sepolia.flashblocks.base.org/ws
```

This endpoint returns a stream of Flashblocks with differential data between blocks to minimize bandwidth usage. The initial block contains complete data while subsequent blocks only include changes.

### Flashblock RPC endpoint

Query the Flashblocks-aware RPC endpoint at:

```
https://sepolia-preconf.base.org
```

This endpoint supports all standard Ethereum JSON-RPC methods plus Flashblocks-specific functionality. You can use the `pending` tag to retrieve the latest Flashblock:

```bash
curl https://sepolia-preconf.base.org \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
    "params": ["pending", true],
    "id": 1
  }'
```
